The Python files contain the algorithms, mathematical analysis, and shared utility code.  We used IPython notebooks to generate many of the plots and figures.  The most important file is modular_matrix.py which contains our LU implementation over a modular field.  Some of the Python files are intended to be imported as dependencies.  Unit tests are located at the bottom of these library files, and can be run conveniently by executing the file.
